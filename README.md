## Problem 1: Minimum Meeting Rooms

### Description
Given a list of meetings with start and end times, determine the minimum number of meeting rooms required such that no meetings overlap.

A meeting that ends at time `t` and another that starts at time `t` do not overlap.

### Example
Input:
[[1,4], [1,5], [5,6], [6,10], [7,9]]

Output:
2

### Time Complexity
O(n log n)
